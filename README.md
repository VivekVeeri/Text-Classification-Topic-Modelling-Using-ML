# Text-Classification-Topic-Modelling-Using-ML
The content has been gathered from the popular academic website "arXiv.org" for articles tagged as computer science content through some of these are in mathematics or physics categories. I have preprocessed the given content of each article and then passed it through various "Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms" and classified whether the article has been belonged to "Computer Science" (or) "Physics" (or) "Mathematics". If the article is of computer science then the boolean value of one is assigned to it and the remaining kind of articles i.e. mathematics and physics are assigned to zero. The same classification is also done through "State-of-Art" algorithms namely "Neural Networks".  Algorithms Used:- Random Forest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks.   In this the content has been gathered from news sites, containing the term "Monash University" (or) tagged with the label "Monash University" by an external annotator. In these obtained content, I have pre-processed the content of various news articles and then passed the obtained pre-processed content to a popular Topic Modelling algorithm namely "Latent Dirichlet Allocation"(LDA), by changing several hyperparameters of it and then running LDA with different runs and observed several interesting factors in which kind of articles the term "Monash University" was present, what could be the reason for it, what other topic of content we could observe from the news articles.
