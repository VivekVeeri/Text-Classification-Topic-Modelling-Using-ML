    "A neural network is a collection of algorithms that attempt to identify underlying associations in a data set through a mechanism that imitates how the human brain functions. We use neural networks to identify associations and hidden trends in raw data as well as to cluster and classify raw data, and to learn and grow continuously over time. There are many neural network strategies like `Perceptrons`, `Convolutional Neural Networks`, `Recurrent Neural Networks` etc. \n",

An RNN takes in sequence of words,  ùëã={ùë•1,...,ùë•ùëá} , one at a time, and for each word produces a hidden state `h`. We use the RNN _recurrently_ by feeding in the current word $x_t$ as well as the hidden state from the previous word, $h_{t-1}$, to generate the next hidden state, $h_t$. \n",

    "     dense vector representation of our sentences & then feed into RNN.\n",

In a supervised classification problem, there exists a true output and a model-generated predicted output for each data point. For this reason, the results for each data point can be assigned to one of four categories:\n",

    " - `False Negative (FN)` - label is positive but prediction is negative\n",

    "**3. Removal of stopwords** - Usually stop words carry little lexical content. They are often functional words in English, for example, articles, pronouns, particles, and so on. In NLP and IR, we usually exclude stop words from the vocabulary. Otherwise, we will face the curse of dimensionality. There are some exceptions, such as syntactic analysis like parsing, we choose to keep those functional words. However, we are going to remove all the stop words by using the stop word list\n",

    "## Conclusion :\n",
    "From this assessment, I had learnt how to implement Text Classification by building three different classifiers on a specific column by using Neural Network model & Machine Learning models.  Also I had learnt the concept of Topic Modelling to discover the abstract contents of a specific topic from a collection of documents available. Here I had used an unsupervised learning methodology called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to classify text in a document to find particular topic and interpret the output of this topic model with the help of visualisations using genism package in Python which helped me in identifying the novel findings from the topic model."
